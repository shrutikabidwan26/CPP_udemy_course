	//Right
	//THE TRICK HERE IS THAT A REFERENCE CAN'T BE CHANGED TO REFERENCE SOMETHING ELSE
	//IF YOU ASSIGN TO A REFERENCE WE WERE DOING IN THE COMMENTED OUT CODE ABOVE,YOU'LLBE
	//JUST CHANGING THE VALUE AT THE REFERENCED ADDRESS, NOT MAKING THE REFERENCE POINT SOMEWHERE ELSE.
	//base IS INITIALIZED TO POINT TO A One object AND IT HAS NO CONCEPT OF m_2 OR m_3. IF YOU ASSIGN A Two
	//OBJECT TO base, THE COMPILER WILL DO THE BEST IT CAN, AND THAT'S JUST GRABBING THE m_1 VALUE IN THE
	//two OBJECT AND ASSIGNING THAT TO THE m_1 VALUE IN THE OBJECT REFERENCED BY base.
	//IF WE WANT POLYMOLPHISM TO WORK HERE THROUGH REFERENCES, WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO SET UP SEPARATE
	//REFERENCES FOR one, two and three. JUST LIKE WE'RE DOING BELOW
