// Description : Write a swap function that can swap any type with an = operator.
//                This is going to be much more powerful than the functions we did before
//                that relied on implicit conversions. That's right! Your function will be
//                able to swap int's with as much ease as it does for std::string's or any
//                other type in C++ with an assignment operator.
/*
To have some context, if we throw the next two std::string's to your function

    std::string x{"Hello"};
    std::string y{"There"};
    swap_data(x,y);
we would expect x to contain "There" and for y to contain "Hello" after the call to     swap_data(x,y);

 

If we change x and y to be int's

    int x{10};
    int y{20};
    swap_data(x,y);
we would x to contain 20 and y to contain 10.
