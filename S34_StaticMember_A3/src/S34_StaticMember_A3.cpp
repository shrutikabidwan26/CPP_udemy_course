// Description : Cool Utility
/*    You will write a class named CoolUtility that works in such a way that the code below
    CoolUtility cu("I can take you from point A to point #");
    cu.what_do_you_do();
    std::cout << std::endl;
    std::cout << "general purpose : " << CoolUtility::s_general_description << std::endl;
will print something like
I can take you from point A to point #
general purpose : Cool utility to move us all to Mars
The class will have two member variables
s_general_description;
m_object_description;
s_general_description will be a static variable storing the message
"Cool utility to move us all to Mars" without any new character at the end.
It will be stored as const char *
m_object_description will be just a non static member variable of type const char *.
You will be careful to initialize it properly with the value the users of the class
pass through the one param constructor.
You will also set up a
void what_do_you_do() const
method that just prints whatever message is stored in m_object_description on
std::cout without any space after the message. */
